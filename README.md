
# Code by Swift

# Background

This is a startup project, we want to create a platform which can share the perform between musicians and shoppers(like Barkeeper,Livehouse boss and so on).
But due to some reasons it was not completed ultimately.

So I regard it as a chance to learn Swift, and push it to GitHub.

Maybe oneday I can totally accomplish this project.


#ToDo

1. Convert from Swift2.3 to Swift3.0 (or later).
2. Finish Server API interface left by Server Engineer.
3. Make it better and better.
